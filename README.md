# SQL Projects

Welcome to my collection of SQL case studies, where I explore real-world datasets to extract meaningful insights using SQL queries. In this project, I tackle three distinct case studies: **Employee Trends Analysis**, **Automotive Industry Trends**, and **Call Center Performance Metrics**.

## Case Study 1: Employee Trends Analysis

In this analysis, I explore HR data to understand employee trends across various departments. Key metrics include:
- Employee distribution across departments
- Average age and job satisfaction by department
- Attrition rates by age band and job satisfaction
- Impact of education and job satisfaction

## Case Study 2: Automotive Industry Trends

This case study dives into data from the automotive industry to analyze trends related to car pricing, mileage, and resale value. Insights include:
- The average selling price for cars by fuel type and transmission
- The top 3 car models by average mileage (considering cars with more than 5 seats)
- Sales and pricing fluctuations over the years

## Case Study 3: Call Center Performance Metrics

This case study focuses on performance metrics from a call center. I clean and analyze the data to uncover:
- Call volume by weekday
- Call duration and customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores
- Response time analysis
- Data cleaning and normalization techniques

## SQL Queries

Each case study includes a variety of SQL queries that demonstrate:
- Data extraction and aggregation
- Calculations such as averages, maximum, and minimum values
- Data transformation and cleaning techniques

You can find the complete set of queries used in this project under the respective case study folders.
